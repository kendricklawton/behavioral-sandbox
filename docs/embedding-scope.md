# Where the engine ends

The line this project refuses to cross, and the surface it intends to pin. A runtime that quietly grows platform features stops being embeddable.

## Where the engine ends (the engine/PaaS line)

**This is an engine, not a PaaS.** The engine is the boring, embeddable core:
a runtime plus a clean driver API you self-host. The moment it grows opinions about *whose* code
runs and *who pays*, it stops being embeddable in anything with its own opinions. So, explicit
non-goals, these belong to whatever hosts the engine, and PRs adding them are wrong by design:

- **No tenancy or auth.** The engine trusts its caller completely; multi-user identity, quotas,
  and authorization live in the hoster's layer.
- **No billing or metering policy.** The engine *measures* (host-observed metrics, benchmarked
  percentiles); charging for it is the hoster's.
- **No fleet scheduling.** One engine drives sandboxes on one host. Bin-packing across hosts,
  queues, and autoscaling are the hoster's: the engine runs sandboxes on its host; it doesn't
  schedule a cluster.
- **No dashboard, no platform API.** The programmatic surface is the Rust library, the CLI, and
  the [`ekvm` daemon](./daemon.md), a *local* driver daemon over a unix socket, a thin host of
  the same library's public API, with no auth and no tenancy (access control is the socket
  directory's permissions). A daemon that grows multi-tenant identity or a public HTTP surface is
  a *hoster*, not this repo.

The line is a security boundary too (013): everything the engine ships is inert without host
privileges the *hoster* grants, it self-limits (deny-by-default network, dropped-uid jail,
own-euid sweep), and turning its tools into a multi-tenant service safely is the hoster's job.

What the engine *does* owe a long-lived host, and ships: typed errors instead of panics on every
hostile-guest path, GC for crashed embedders' residue (`sweep_orphans`), dependency guards that
fail legibly (`xtask setup`'s degradation matrix, the pinned Firecracker probe), measured budgets
(fd, boot, restore, memory-sharing), and a wire protocol whose version handshake makes skew a typed error
instead of a silent misbehavior.

Downstream of the public API, the language SDKs (Go/Python/Node/C#) are planned to live in separate
repos. None of them exist yet. The intent is that they pin this crate's git rev; the surface the
project intends to pin and its movement rules are the
[Semver section](#semver--api-stability) below.

**The crates are never published to crates.io** (`publish = false` across the workspace), a
decision, not a gap. A crates.io version is immutable and available forever, but this engine's
support window is computed from Firecracker's and deliberately ends: an old published version
would sit on the registry looking usable long after every VMM it can drive stopped receiving
patches. Distribution stays the signed release package for operators and the git-rev pin for
embedders, both of which the support policy in `RELEASES.md` can actually govern.

## Semver & API stability

> **Not yet in force.** No release exists, so nothing below governs anything today. This section
> describes the boundary the project intends to pin at `v0.1.0`; until that tag, every item on it can
> change without notice. Pin a git rev.

The `vmm` public library API and the `channel` wire protocol are the surface the project intends to
pin as its stability boundary:
- **`Sandbox`**, **`Limits`**, **`RunResult`**
- **`VmmError`**, including variants and the `kind()` -> `ErrorKind` bucket mapping
- The **`channel`** wire framing protocol

### Versioning rules
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to the pinned surface (removed/renamed `VmmError` variants, changed `kind()` bucket mappings, breaking channel wire protocol changes, or raising `Limits` defaults).
- **MINOR**: Additive changes (new API methods, new `#[non_exhaustive]` error variants, new optional fields).
- **Commit Tags**: Changes touching this surface are marked with `feat(api):` or `fix(api)!:` in commit subjects for clear auditability.
