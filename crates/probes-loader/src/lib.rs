//! `agent-probes-loader` — the userspace side of the eBPF story: load and attach the probes from
//! `crates/probes`, read their maps, and stream events into the audit log. Phase 8 attaches the
//! one host-global `sys_enter_execve` tracepoint (scoped to nothing); binding a program to a
//! *specific* sandbox (its cgroup, its tap device) arrives with the per-VM taps in Phase 10.
//!
//! **P8.3 — attach + read a map.** [`ExecveCounter`] loads the compiled BPF object, attaches the
//! `count_execve` tracepoint to `syscalls/sys_enter_execve`, and reads its per-CPU counter map,
//! summing the slots into one total. Synchronous by design: aya's load/attach/array-read path takes
//! no async runtime, matching the driver's no-background-threads posture. This counts the **host's**
//! `execve` footprint (a microVM's own syscalls never trap here; see ROADMAP Phase 9) — the introduction
//! that proves the load → attach → read → drop path before Phase 10 binds programs to real taps.
//!
//! **P8.5/P8.6 — CO-RE and the verifier.** The object is built against BTF, so aya relocates it
//! against the running kernel at load (Compile Once, Run Everywhere — portable across kernels). The
//! program also keeps a per-PID hash map, surfaced here as
//! [`counts_by_pid`](ExecveCounter::counts_by_pid); its lookup-or-init and bounded-loop patterns are
//! the verifier rules the eBPF side hits on purpose.
//!
//! **P8.4 — drops with the loader.** [`ExecveCounter`] owns the aya [`Ebpf`], whose `Drop`
//! detaches the program (dropping the link) and frees the map. Nothing is **pinned** into
//! `/sys/fs/bpf`, so there is no kernel residue to leak: a crashed loader leaves no dangling
//! attachment, the eBPF analogue of the driver's no-leak teardown. Pinning stays opt-in, added only
//! where a program must outlive its loader (not here).
//!
//! **P9.1/P9.2 — a per-event syscall trace, filtered to one sandbox.** [`SyscallTracer`] loads the
//! same object but attaches the three `sys_enter_{execve,openat,connect}` tracepoints, each of which
//! streams a whole [`SyscallEvent`] (pid, tid, cgroup id, `comm`, and the path or sockaddr bytes) into
//! a **ring buffer** the tracer drains with [`drain`](SyscallTracer::drain). Where [`ExecveCounter`]
//! answers "how many", the tracer answers "which, by whom, on what". Point it at one Firecracker
//! worker with [`watch_pid`](SyscallTracer::watch_pid) /
//! [`watch_cgroup`](SyscallTracer::watch_cgroup) so it records that sandbox's host footprint and not
//! the whole machine's. Still the host's footprint, not the guest's (a microVM's syscalls stay
//! in-guest; see ROADMAP Phase 9).
//!
//! **P9.3/P9.4 — a live trace, attributed to a sandbox.** [`stream`](SyscallTracer::stream) is the
//! streaming consumer: it loops, decoding each event with [`SyscallEvent::describe`] and handing it to
//! a callback as it arrives, until a caller predicate says stop. [`cgroup_id_of_pid`] closes the loop
//! with the Firecracker track: hand it a sandbox's VMM pid, `watch_cgroup` the id it returns, and the
//! trace is scoped to exactly that sandbox (the `bpf_get_current_cgroup_id` a program reads equals the
//! inode of the cgroup dir the jailer placed the VMM in).
//!
//! **P10 — network flows on the tap.** [`TapMonitor`] attaches the two `tc`/clsact classifiers
//! (`tap_ingress`/`tap_egress`) to a VM's tap and reads their per-flow byte/packet counters with
//! [`flows`](TapMonitor::flows), or the per-VM rollup with [`totals`](TapMonitor::totals) (P10.3). This
//! is the guest's *own* traffic (every packet crosses the tap on the host), the strong cross-boundary
//! signal syscalls can't be. [`attach_in_netns`](TapMonitor::attach_in_netns) binds the *specific* tap
//! the driver named for one sandbox by entering that sandbox's netns (P10.4, decision 017/024);
//! [`attach`](TapMonitor::attach) takes an interface in the current netns.
//!
//! **P11.1/P11.2 — egress enforcement.** [`set_egress_policy`](TapMonitor::set_egress_policy) installs an
//! [`EgressPolicy`] (a deny-by-default allow-list of destination CIDRs + optional port/proto) into the
//! classifier's policy map and arms enforcement, so the tap drops any guest-sent packet that matches no
//! rule and accepts those that do — per VM. It is opt-in: until set, a monitor stays observe-only (the
//! Phase 10 behavior); [`clear_egress_policy`](TapMonitor::clear_egress_policy) returns it there. Every
//! drop is recorded per destination; [`denials`](TapMonitor::denials) reads that audit trail (P11.5).
//!
//! **P11.3/P11.4 — policy at launch, deny-by-default.** [`EgressPolicy`] is the userspace schema, built
//! from validated [`Ipv4Cidr`]s with a typed [`Protocol`] and optional port (`None` = any), whose empty
//! value ([`EgressPolicy::deny_all`], the
//! [`Default`]) allows nothing — a sandbox launched with no explicit allowance reaches nothing.
//! [`enforce_in_netns`](TapMonitor::enforce_in_netns) applies a policy *before* the tc programs go live
//! on a sandbox's tap, so there is no window where the tap is up but un-policed: enforcement is in effect
//! from the first packet.
//!
//! **P8.8/P8.9 — caps + a legible support probe.** Loading needs only `CAP_BPF`+`CAP_PERFMON`, not
//! full root; [`check_support`] names a missing prerequisite (kernel BTF, or those caps) up front as a
//! typed [`ProbeError::Unsupported`], so a host that can't run the probes says so plainly instead of
//! failing with a cryptic verifier reject or `EPERM` (the eBPF analogue of the driver's dependency
//! guards, P6.9b).
